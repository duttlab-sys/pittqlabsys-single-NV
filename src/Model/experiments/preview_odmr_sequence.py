"""
Preview an ODMR pulsed sequence.

Builds and shows the example sequence WITHOUT creating an ODMRPulsedExperiment,
so no devices are connected. All the sequence work is done by
ODMRSequencePreview (see odmr_sequence_preview.py).

Run this from your project root (the folder that contains `src/`).
